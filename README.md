# Trip Notification Feature

	This feature enables users to receive email alerts when a friend adds them to a trip on our platform. Once a user is added to a trip, our system automatically generates an email notification to inform them about the addition. 

This ensures seamless communication and collaboration among trip participants, enhancing the overall trip planning experience.


	In order to use this feature:

	Make sure that you are logged in with a valid username. After this, navigate to “Trips” page. On the “Trips” page, you will see all the trips that you have created as a user and all the trips you have been added to. Each trip item has a field to add friends. To add friends to the trip, type your friend’s username - In order for this feature to work accordingly, you will have to type in a valid username.- in this field, and click on the “Add a Friend” button below. If such an action is successful, we will notify the user you added to the trip that they have been added to a trip, and after refreshing the page, your friend’s username will show up on the trip item.
